Hello, 2020! I decided to post my learning notes here this year of how to code with python, for a small reason --
I'm a non-computer science major and a most-of-the-time self-learner. There are certainly great sources on-line to help us study coding these days, but still I've been spending a great amount of time, sometimes, on finding a simple/tiny answer to a basic question. So whenever I understand some little things that were hard for me to find, I will post them here.

Hopefully, I will not need to come back to these notes after I post them since that will mean I forgot the knowledge I have learned once! (I usually need to learn the same thing two to infinite times before I truly learned it.) If anyone came across this notes website, and find something useful, and you've made the best day of my life. If you didn't, click my website, and you can at least meet me who you are smarter than:) [ling nerd](https://boruizhang.github.io/)
