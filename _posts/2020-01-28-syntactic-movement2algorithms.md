*This is a collection of syntactic movements, and still on-going: (last update Feb 16 2020)*

**Wh-movements** are one kind of A-bar movement.

**A-movement** is for Case, and language specific.

**Theta role** is assigned locally.

**Echo question** (in English) has no surface movement.

**CP** is a projection associated with questions.

**narrow syntax** The process from DS to SS is called .

**XPs (P-level)** cannot move to X (head-level).

**Wh-fronting languages** are when a language is obligated to move wh. Movements are required. The opposite word of it is wh-in-situ.

**MLC** Minimal Link Condition - successive cyclic - West Ulster English "all".

**In-situ-languages** James Huang, wh-movement (when there is a question, roughly) can have two types, English-overtly, Chinese-covertly.

**Two ways to get wh-islands** 1. One wh already occupying the Spec CP spot, and the second one cannot override this occupied position. 2. One wh- trace is already occupying the Spec CP spot, and the second wh cannot override this trace-occupied spec position.

**null operator  in Chinese** is a featured ("null") operator. As a last resort of LF movement for in-situ languages. The Idea: this thing is actual thing, a XP stays at Spec DP, and overtly moves so create island effects.

**binding operator in Chinese** is a XP locating in Spec CP.


| Movement properties | English | Chinese | Japanese |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| wh-movement | + | - | - |
| operator-movement | + | - | + |
| in-situ/fronting | fronting | in-situ | in-situ |
| island effects | + | - | + |

**Indeterminate pronouns** [wh, existential quantifier, universal quantifier, a negative polarity item]

**Kayne** thinks that there is SOV language, all of these kind of langauges are derived from SVO in DS.

**Feature percolation** (Syntactic background: If a head X has a feature, it can pass this feature to its own XP as the farthest the feature can go in the tree, aka, XP also has this feature.) Current notion says such feature can go as far as it can to higher position in the tree.

**Pied-piping structure** Traditionally, wh-word movement is a type of A-bar. Now, the wh-word is not moving by itself. But a bigger phrase that contains it, moves front.
