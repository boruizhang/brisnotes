*This is a collection of syntactic movements, and still on-going: (last updated April 16th, 2020)*

**Wh-movements** are one kind of A-bar movement.

**A-movement** is for Case, and language-specific.

**Theta role** is assigned locally.

**Echo question** (in English) has no surface movement.

**CP** is a projection associated with questions.

**narrow syntax** The process from DS to SS is called.

**XPs (P-level)** cannot move to X (head-level).

**Wh-fronting languages** are when a language is obligated to move wh. Movements are required. The opposite word of it is wh-in-situ.

**MLC** Minimal Link Condition - successive cyclic - West Ulster English "all".

**In-situ-languages** James Huang, wh-movement (when there is a question, roughly) can have two types, English-overtly, Chinese-covertly.

**Two ways to get wh-islands** 1. One wh already occupying the Spec CP spot, and the second one cannot override this occupied position. 2. One wh- trace is already occupying the Spec CP spot, and the second wh cannot override this trace-occupied spec position.

**null operator  in Chinese** is a featured ("null") operator. As a last resort of LF movement for in-situ languages. The Idea: this thing is an actual thing, an XP stays at Spec DP, and overtly moves so create island effects.

**binding operator in Chinese** is an XP locating in Spec CP.


| Movement properties | English | Chinese | Japanese |
|-------|-------|--------|---------|
| wh-movement | + | - | - |
| operator-movement | + | - | + |
| in-situ/fronting | fronting | in-situ | in-situ |
| island effects | + | - | + |

**Indeterminate pronouns** [wh, existential quantifier, universal quantifier, a negative polarity item]

**Kayne** thinks that there is SOV language, all of this kind of languages are derived from SVO in DS.

**Feature percolation** (Syntactic background: If a head X has a feature, it can pass this feature to its own XP as the farthest the feature can go in the tree, aka, XP also has this feature.) The current notion says such a feature can go as far as it can to a higher position in the tree.

**Pied-piping structure** Traditionally, wh-movement is a type of A-bar. Now, the wh-word is not moving by itself. But a bigger phrase that contains it, moves front.

**Concealed questions** A verb that takes a DP complement, and this DP is associated with wh-questions. - "Bill found out [the plane's arrival time]."

**Attitude predicates** The verbs that take CP as complements are attitude verbs (aka refer to mental states). Inside of this category, verbs are different in small groups.

**Factives** when a verb takes a complement CP which is presupposed to be true.

**Veridical** when a verb takes a complement CP which is entailed to be true by the verb.

**If an expression has prepositions...**, this expression, most of the time, is a full sentence (namely we can judge or give a truth value of it). However, sometimes a certain syntactic DP expression which carries the semantic feature of **concealed questions** could also have prepositions (e.g. *I know [the time]*).

**Tests for preposition** questions, condition, negation should pass the test.

**Test for entailments** if an embedded CP is entailed by the verb, apply 'But ... NEG' should #.

**Sentential force** is equivalent to syntactic form, clausal type, and mood.

**Illocutionary force** is equivalent to pragmatics.

**Exclamatives clauses** which is a sentential form can yield three semantic classes: *factivity*, *scalar implicature*, *inability to function in question/answer pairs*.

**Syntactic forms of exclamatives**: wh-ex, NP-ex, and yes/no-ex.

**Scalar implicature** because of the nature of the exclamatives (how/what) starting sentences, they can have scalar implicatures

**Exclamatives** can either widen a domain or give factivity.

**The domain of "HOW"**: amount, reason, instrument, quality, and numeric.

**Cyclic movements** an element sequential moves cross through clauses, and this movement style is nesting but not crossing.

**Strong feature** trigger movements: C [+W] [+wh] are strong features. The strong features need to be checked as early as possible in the derivation.

**Superiority** if more than one phrase can move, the one that is "higher" (or the one c-commands the other) moves first. --> Superiority iff c-command.

**Anti-superiority** anti-c-command movements.

**Wh-island** A CP's spec position is already filled, if another one is trying to move there, it going to hit an island.

**Parasitic gap** a gap appears to be dependent on another "gap".

**Specificity** speaker knows and listeners do not know.

**Definiteness** speaker and listeners both know.

**D-linked** Discourse-linked element, (eg. *which*)

**Ellipsis** Deletion under identities of previously mentioned.

**Alternative questions** Whether questions:

**Polar questions**:

**The semantic side of question**:
**Embedding approach** Lewis (1970) who came? I ask who came is true iff i ask who came.

**propositional approach**
1. (Hamblin 1985 1973): A question characterizes the set of its answers.
2. Karttumen(1977) modified Hamblin's idea: a questiion denotes a set of statements which counts as true answers to that question. (searching for "holding" symbols)

**de re versus dicto** problem for Karttumen

**strong and weak exhaustivity** *know* is sensitive to right answers. Some predicates cares about what are the right answers and care about what are the wrong answers.

Gronenedjik and Stokhof (1984) challenged Karttumen with the example of *know* case

**mention-some answer** The answers to the wh-questions has modal auxiliaries. we get some coffee?

**exhaustive answer** The answers to the wh-questions has non-modal auxiliaries.

**copy theory vs trace theory**: "Basically the same thing"

**Holmberg** is a fan of question-and-answer (A yes-no question is not really about two words, but a rich hidden structure), all about PolPs, TP is incomplete. PolP is the minimal complete unit.

**Short answers** exists in the world is due to movement and deletion.

**Numeration** Chomsky 1995.

**Negative questions** Answers to negative questions flavor in for the positive answer.

**Holmberg**'s big Ellipsis -- To form an echo answer to a yes/no question, the v head move up to a focus position, and the rest of the projection gets deleted.

**Canonical question** Speaker has truly information0-seeking without any prior knowledge.

**Non-canonical question** Well, the opposite of canonical question: e.g. Tag question, retorical question, echo, negative polarity q, declarative, rhetorical, ability/inclination questions.

**A question** is not a homogeneous class, a diverse set of constructions.

**rogative question** like 'wonder'

**inrrogative question** like 'know'

**responsive questions** the verbs can either be rogative or inrrogative.

**inner negation** *Is it the case that [... NEG ...]*

**outer negation**  *Is it NOT the case that [...]*

**Gunlogson** the first person looking at declarative raising
